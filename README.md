# Online Retail Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

## Business Problem
In the realm of online retail, understanding and predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is crucial. CLV represents the total value a customer brings to a business over their entire relationship. It's a key metric for decision-making, aiding in customer retention strategies, personalized marketing, and overall business growth.

## Project Overview
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an online retail dataset to unravel insights and trends.
- Employed statistical analysis to comprehend the significance of various features in relation to CLV.
- Extracted and processed relevant columns for CLV analysis, involving operations and calculations.
- Calculated Customer Lifetime Value using a tailored formula.

## Dataset Description
The dataset encapsulates diverse facets of online retail, featuring columns such as invoice number, invoice date, stock code, description, quantity, unit price, customer ID, and country.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Unveiled essential insights through visualizations:
### Univariate Analysis
- Explored the distribution of CLV, revealing potential skewness.
- Examined customer distribution across different regions.

### Bivariate Analysis
- Investigated the correlation between CLV and relevant factors like quantity and unit price.

### Multivariate Analysis
- Unearthed relationships and correlations between CLV, quantity, and unit price.

## Data Preprocessing
- Identified and removed duplicate values to ensure data integrity.

## Statistical Analysis
Utilized the `describe()` function to derive key statistical measures, shedding light on data distribution.

## Customer Lifetime Value Calculation
Applied specific operations on the dataset to filter and manipulate necessary columns, leading to the calculation of Customer Lifetime Value.

## Conclusion
- The analysis provides insights into customer behavior, helping formulate strategies for customer retention and targeted marketing.
- Statistical measures offer a quantitative understanding of the dataset.
- The calculated CLV serves as a foundational metric for making informed business decisions.
